//        You can buy life insurance that will last anywhere between 1-30 years.
//        If you pass away before the policy has expired, your beneficiaries will
//        be paid out the death benefit. If you wish to continue having life insurance
//        after the policy expires, you could either renew your policy or switch
//        providers entirely, at a new higher age adjusted premium rate. It is also
//        important to keep in mind that some policies have a 10-year policy cap restriction
//        past the age of 50.</p>
//        <p>Term life insurance is a more affordable option than other forms of insurance
//        because of its fixed time. It is suitable if you are looking to protect dependents
//        for a limited period of time.</p>
//        <p>Term life insurance is an appropriate option if you are not seeking a savings
//        component and would like straight-forward protection at a lower premium.</p>`,

//     protection as long as you pay your set premium every month. Each time you pay
//     the monthly premium, a portion goes to your death benefit and a portion is set aside
//     to your cash value account. The cash value functions as a savings account. When you pass
//     away, your family will receive the full un-taxed death benefit. Even though permanent life
//     insurance guarantees coverage for life, it is less popular because it is more expensive
//     than term life insurance.</p><p>The advantage of a cash value component is the option
//     to use that money for personal expenses or take a loan from that amount. If you withdraw,
//     that money may be taxed, and if you take out a loan, that amount will be deducted from the
//     death benefit if the loan is not paid back.</p><p>If you have living dependents, are looking
//      to build a tax-advantaged inheritance and/or have outlived your term life policy,
//      permanent life insurance may be for you.</p>`

//     lifelong coverage, and the premium consists of contributions for the death benefit
//     and cash value. In the case of variable life insurance, the cash value operates similar
//     to a mutual fund. The cash value is invested by professional fund managers; over time
//     the cash value will fluctuate based on your investment options. The cash invested grows
//     tax-free. However, if you withdraw from the cash value, you may incur taxes and fees.</p>

//     insurance of Life+ provides you term life insurance, plus an option to save money that
//     will stay with you even after your term expires. If you pass away before the term expires,

//     some financial safety for end of life expenses.</p><p>Similar to permanent life
//     insurance, you have the option to contribute to your cash value every month, and
//     you have the flexibility to decide how much to contribute every month. That way,
